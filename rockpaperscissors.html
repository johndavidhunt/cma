Note: JavaScript examples from class are posted as part of my CMA GitHub repository.

JavaScript

Complete the exercises in the "Introduction to JavaScript" and "Functions" sections of the Codecademy JavaScript Course. Only the first two sections are required, but you may continue with more advanced topics if you like.
When you complete the "Rock Paper Scissors" example, copy and paste your full JavaScript code from Codecademy into a <script> tag in a new HTML file. Save this file as "rockpaperscissors.html" in the Columbia Museum of Art site and push it to GitHub.
jQuery

Review Gio's jQuery examples.
Create a "Menu" button for the Columbia Museum of Art web page from last week's homework. Style the button to match the exisitng webpage styles.
Add jQuery to the Membership page.
Create and link an external script.js file to the Membership page.
Use jQuery to hide the menu when the page loads, and to toggle the menu when the button is clicked or tapped.
Commit and push your example to GitHub, and email the link to your instructor.
